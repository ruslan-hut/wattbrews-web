- ‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` - Added `.env` files to ignore list
- ‚úÖ Created `env.example` - Template for team members
- ‚úÖ Updated both environment files - Now use placeholders instead of real keys

### 2. Firebase App Check Integration
- ‚úÖ Updated `app.config.ts` - Added Firebase App Check provider
- ‚úÖ Configured reCAPTCHA v3 integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Next Steps (MUST DO)

You **MUST** complete these steps in order:

### Step 1: Regenerate API Key (CRITICAL - Do First)
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project "evcharge-68bc8"
3. Navigate to Project Settings ‚Üí General
4. Regenerate the Web API Key
5. **Save the new key** - you'll need it for Step 4

> The old key `AIzaSyB0...xSEkw` is PERMANENTLY COMPROMISED

### Step 2: Add API Key Restrictions (CRITICAL)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to APIs & Credentials ‚Üí Credentials
3. Edit the Web API Key
4. Add HTTP referrer restrictions:
   - `https://wattbrews.me/*`
   - `http://localhost:4200/*`
5. Add API restrictions (restrict to Firebase APIs only)
6. Save

### Step 3: Set Up reCAPTCHA v3 (Required for Production)
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí App Check
2. Register your web app
3. Set up reCAPTCHA v3
4. Get the **Site Key** (not secret key)
5. Save this key for Step 4

### Step 4: Configure Local Environment
```bash
# 1. Create .env file
cp env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env and add YOUR credentials
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor

# Add these values:
# FIREBASE_API_KEY=<new-key-from-step-1>
# RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=<site-key-from-step-3>
# ... other values from env.example

# 3. Generate environment files
npm run config:dev

# 4. Test locally
npm start
```

### Step 5: Clean Git History (After Steps 1-4)
```bash
# This removes the old key from ALL commits
./scripts/clean-git-history.sh

# Verify the key is gone
git log --all -S'AIzaSyB0...xSEkw'
# (Should return no results)
```

### Step 6: Force Push Clean History
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This rewrites public git history
# Coordinate with your team first!

git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

### Step 7: Update Team
Send this message to your team:

```
üîí SECURITY UPDATE REQUIRED

Our git repository history has been cleaned to remove a compromised API key.

ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Save all your uncommitted work
2. Delete your local repository
3. Clone fresh: git clone https://github.com/ruslan-hut/wattbrews-web.git
4. Install: npm install
5. Configure: cp env.example .env (then edit with credentials)
6. Run: npm run config:dev
7. Test: npm start

Contact me if you need the new Firebase credentials.
```

## üìä Changes Made to Files

### New Files Created
```
scripts/set-env.js                     - Environment file generator
scripts/clean-git-history.sh           - Git history cleanup
scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh             - Pre-commit security checks
scripts/install-hooks.sh               - Hook installation helper
.github/workflows/deploy.yml.example   - CI/CD template
SECURITY_SETUP.md                      - Security guide
QUICK_REFERENCE.md                     - Quick reference
IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md              - This file
```

### Modified Files
```
.gitignore                             - Added .env files
package.json                           - Added npm scripts
README.md                              - Added security warnings
src/environments/environment.ts        - Replaced key with placeholder
src/environments/environment.development.ts - Replaced key with placeholder
src/app/app.config.ts                  - Added Firebase App Check
env.example                            - Updated with all variables
```

### Files NOT Committed (Local Only)
```
.env                                   - Your credentials (gitignored)
```

## üéØ How the Security System Works

### Before (Insecure)
```
Firebase API Key ‚Üí Hardcoded in environment.ts ‚Üí Committed to git ‚Üí PUBLIC
```

### After (Secure)
```
Step 1: Local Development
.env (local, not committed) 
  ‚Üí set-env.js reads .env
  ‚Üí Generates environment.ts with real values
  ‚Üí Angular uses for build
  ‚Üí NOT committed (git shows placeholders)

Step 2: CI/CD Production
Environment Variables (GitHub Secrets)
  ‚Üí set-env.js reads env vars
  ‚Üí Generates environment.ts with real values
  ‚Üí Angular builds production app
  ‚Üí Deployed

Step 3: Git Repository
Only placeholders committed:
  apiKey: "PLACEHOLDER_WILL_BE_REPLACED_BY_BUILD_SCRIPT"
  
Real values NEVER touch git.
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Layers Added

1. **Environment Variables**: Secrets stored outside code
2. **API Key Restrictions**: Limits usage to your domains
3. **Firebase App Check**: Verifies legitimate app traffic
4. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Prevents accidental secret commits
5. **Git History Cleanup**: Removes old compromised key
6. **Build-time Injection**: Values added during build, not in repo

## üìà Next Steps After Implementation

1. **Monitor for 7 days**:
   - Check Firebase usage daily
   - Review billing for unexpected charges
   - Watch for suspicious authentication activity

2. **Team Education**:
   - Share QUICK_REFERENCE.md with team
   - Ensure everyone understands .env workflow
   - Install git hooks on all machines

3. **CI/CD Setup**:
   - Add secrets to GitHub/GitLab/etc.
   - Test automated builds
   - Verify App Check works in production

4. **Documentation**:
   - Keep SECURITY_SETUP.md updated
   - Document any issues encountered
   - Update runbooks as needed

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before considering this complete:

- [ ] Old API key regenerated in Firebase
- [ ] New API key has restrictions applied
- [ ] reCAPTCHA v3 configured for App Check
- [ ] Billing and usage reviewed (no abuse detected)
- [ ] `.env` file created locally
- [ ] `npm start` works without errors
- [ ] No "PLACEHOLDER" errors in browser console
- [ ] Git history cleaned (old key not found)
- [ ] Changes force-pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Team notified and repositories re-cloned
- [ ] CI/CD secrets configured
- [ ] Production deployment tested
- [ ] App Check working in production
- [ ] Git hooks installed (`./scripts/install-hooks.sh`)

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check `SECURITY_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
2. Check `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for common issues
3. Review this implementation summary
4. Check Firebase and Google Cloud Console for errors

---

**Remember**: The old API key is permanently compromised. No amount of restriction or cleanup will make it safe again. You MUST regenerate it.

Good luck! üöÄ
